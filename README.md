## Boolean Flag

A tiny Next.js landing page with a single oversized button: a glossy green "boolean flag". Every click uses your browser's Speech Synthesis API to say **"boolean flag"**, inspired by the looping audio from the [Lizard Button](https://lizardbutton.site/) meme site.

### Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

If you don't hear anything on click:
- **Check browser support**: Speech synthesis works best in modern desktop browsers like Chrome or Edge.
- **Allow audio**: Make sure the tab isn't muted and your system volume is up.
